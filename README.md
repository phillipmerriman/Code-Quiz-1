# Code-Quiz-1
A quiz app testing users knowledge of the great Harriet Tubman.

## Motivation
I wanted to make a quiz using vanilla javasacript to showcase what I've learned so far. I'm sure when I look back on this months from now, I'll see many things that can be done better, but this is what I got so far!

## Screenshots

## How to use?
To start the quiz, click the "begin" button and read through the questions and click on the answer as soon as possible, because the score is your final time! With each incorrect answer, you lose time!
